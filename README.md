### Install database

Create Google Firebase/Firestore account for data storage.
[Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)

1. Sign into https://firebase.google.com/ to get started

2. Click on "create a project" and follow the steps. Start in test mode then start a collection, ("Auto-ID" to generate a random Document ID).

3. Install Firestore via Firebase: ```npm install firebase```

4. Create a new directory "config" and add a new file "firebase.js" to it. 

5. Back in the Firebase project in the browser, open up "Settings", then "General" tab. Under the section "Your apps", link Firebase to app by clicking the tag icon.

6. After connecting, it will generate configurations for different platforms. Here, click "Firestore for Web" and then copy the contents of the config object info to config/firebaseConfig.dist.js file. Initialize the App by adding ```import firebase from firebase``` at the top of the file firebase.js and initialize the app there like so: ```const firebaseApp = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)```

7. Change the name in the reference to the Firestore collection in components/chat.js file from currently "messages" to the name choosen for the collection.
